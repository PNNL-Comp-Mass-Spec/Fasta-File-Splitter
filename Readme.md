Fasta File Splitter

This program reads a protein fasta file and splits it apart 
into a number of sections.  Although the splitting is random, 
each section will have a nearly identical number of residues.

Use the /N switch to the define the number of sections.

Example:
  FastaFileSplitter.exe H_sapiens_IPI_2008-02-07.fasta /N:25
